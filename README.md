**React Pizza**
---------
React Pizza is a simple e-commerce web application where users can choose pizzas from a menu and/or create their own, and afterwards add them to a shopping cart. The shopping cart component allows the user to edit the cart and see the pricing update in real time.

**Motivation**
---------
This is the first application I built using React and Redux, and the main purpose of building this application was simply to understand these tools a little better.

**Tech Used**
---------
React | Redux | Thunk | Semantic UI

**Get Started**

This is only the backend side of this project. The frontend can be found at https://github.com/Rsja12/react-pizza-client. Clone down this repo to your machine. Make sure to run `bundle install`, `rails db:seed`, and start a rails server with `rails s`. After doing these steps, follow along the readme for the frontend.
