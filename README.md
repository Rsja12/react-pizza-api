#React Pizza 

This is a simple application where users can create different pizzas.

#Get Started

This is only the backend side of this project. The frontend can be found at https://github.com/Rsja12/react-pizza-client. Clone down both this repo and the frontend repo down to your machine. Make sure to run `bundle install`, `rails db:seed`, and start a rails server with `rails s`. After doing both of these steps, follow along the readme for the frontend.
